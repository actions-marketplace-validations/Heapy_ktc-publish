# ktc-publish

Run checks and publish **JetBrains Kotlin Toolchain** libraries, or prepare a
Maven Central bundle for inspection. Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with
Node.js 22+, Bash, and an installed Kotlin Toolchain (>= 0.12.1 for Maven Central).

The default `bundle` mode creates a local Maven Central ZIP. Uploading to a Maven
repository requires the explicit `mode: publish` input.

```yaml
name: Publish library
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    environment: release
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: Heapy/setup-ktc@v1
      - uses: Heapy/ktc-publish@v1
        with:
          mode: publish
          repository: mavenCentral
          central-username: ${{ secrets.CENTRAL_USERNAME }}
          central-password: ${{ secrets.CENTRAL_PASSWORD }}
          signing-key: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_KEY }}
          signing-passphrase: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_PASSPHRASE }}
```

Use release commit SHAs for immutable references. Configure the `release`
environment and its approvals according to your repository's publishing policy.
The action respects `settings.publishing.mavenCentral.publishingMode` in your
module: `manual` stages for portal review; `auto` releases. It does not change
versions, POM metadata, signing settings, repositories, or that release policy.

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `working-directory` | `.` | Project folder relative to workspace |
| `mode` | `bundle` | `bundle` or `publish` |
| `repository` | `mavenCentral` | Repository ID; bundle mode requires mavenCentral |
| `modules` | empty | Comma/whitespace-separated modules; empty selects all eligible modules |
| `transitive` | `false` | Publish local dependencies of selected modules too |
| `check` | `true` | Run registered checks before the operation |
| `central-username` | empty | Central Portal token username |
| `central-password` | empty | Central Portal token password |
| `signing-key` | empty | ASCII-armored PGP private key |
| `signing-passphrase` | empty | Optional key passphrase |
| `upload-artifacts` | `true` | Upload generated JAR/ZIP files after success |
| `artifact-name` | OS/architecture/job based | Unique artifact name |

Outputs: `mode`, `repository`, `published`. `published: true` means the CLI publish
command succeeded, not that a staged Central deployment has been released.

Configure `settings.publishing` in `module.yaml` before use. Central needs POM
metadata, sources, and signing configuration; bundle mode also needs signing
credentials when signing is enabled. An alternative repository must be declared
with `publish: true`. For local integration testing use `mode: publish` and
`repository: mavenLocal`.

Credentials can also be supplied through Kotlin Toolchain's documented environment
variables. Inputs override their matching variables only in the publication process;
Central/signing credentials are withheld from the preliminary check subprocess.
Custom-repository credentials remain under your project's normal configuration.
Keys are never written to disk or cache by this action. Artifact uploads include
JAR and ZIP files under `build/`, retained for seven days; disable uploads if your
build produces unrelated private archives there.

Development: `npm test` and `npm run check`. CI performs actual publication to
Maven Local and verifies its POM/JAR on all three operating systems. It never
publishes test artifacts to Maven Central.

## Running verification scripts

The `.main.kts` scripts require JDK 25 and Kotlin 2.4.21+ (`kotlinr` on `PATH`).
Run them with `kotlinr scripts/<name>.main.kts` from the repository root.
The Kotlin Toolchain `./kotlin` command is a separate executable. CI installs the script runner
through [Heapy/setup-main-kts](https://github.com/Heapy/setup-main-kts), pinned to v1.0.1's
commit SHA. The action caches the compiler, Maven dependencies, and compiled scripts between
eligible CI runs. The first script run compiles the script and resolves any pinned Maven
dependencies; later runs reuse the script cache.
